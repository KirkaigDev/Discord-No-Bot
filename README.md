This is a very niche bot that I built for a cult-like discord server. The group is dedicated to the word "no" and that's what the bot is built on. It counts the amount of times one says "no" and attributes that to a score and uses a leaderboard. There are more "no" themed features planned such as an RPG and plans for automatic moderation.

## Purpose
* To count the word no and associate it with points

## Features
* No counter, the bot counts all instances of no and assigns points to each user
* Leaderboard, there is a leaderboard featuring the users that have the top 10 points of that server
* A spam channel, the bot will not reply to comments featuring no in the specified channel(s)
